GeminiDesk is more than a wrapper. It's a command center, loaded with powerful, exclusive features that will make you wonder how you ever lived without them.

*   **🤖 Your Choice of Playground: Gemini or AI Studio**
    Start your session your way. Choose between the classic **Gemini** chat interface for streamlined conversations or the powerful **AI Studio** for advanced prompt engineering and development.

*   **🗓️ Deep Research Automation: Your AI Autopilot**
    Schedule complex research tasks to run automatically! Set a day, time, and a detailed prompt. GeminiDesk will launch, switch to the Pro model and execute your "Deep Research" query, all without you lifting a finger.

*   **📄 Flawless PDF Export: Your Chats, Perfected**
    Export your conversations into beautifully formatted PDF documents. With full support for **Right-to-Left (RTL)** languages like Hebrew and Arabic, and perfect rendering of **KaTeX math equations**, your chats have never looked better on paper.

*   **📸 Screenshot to Chat: See It, Snip It, Solve It!**
    Instantly snip any part of your screen with a hotkey. The image is magically beamed into your chat, ready for Gemini's brilliant analysis. It's like having a conversation with your screen!

*   **⚡️ Instant Model Switching: Flash or Pro? Decide in a Flash.**
    Why click through menus? Use dedicated hotkeys (`Alt+F`, `Alt+P`) to instantly fire up a new chat with either the lightning-fast **Flash** model or the powerhouse **Pro** model. Your workflow just got a nitrous boost.

*   **🔊 Audio Feedback: Never Miss a Beat**
    Know the second your AI has finished its thought. GeminiDesk plays a subtle, satisfying sound the moment the response is complete, so you can look away and multitask without losing your place.

*   **🌍 Speak Your Language: Full Internationalization**
    The entire app interface, from tooltips to the settings menu, is available in multiple languages. Select your preferred language for a truly native experience.

*   **🔧 Your Cockpit, Your Rules: Customizable Toolbar**
    Take control of your workspace. **Drag and drop** the toolbar buttons to reorder them exactly as you like. Don't need a button? Simply hide it in the settings.

*   **🔎 Find Anything, Instantly**
    Lost a brilliant idea in the chat abyss? Hit `Alt+S` to immediately focus the chat history search bar. Need to find text within the current conversation? `Ctrl+F` brings up a sleek, in-page find bar.

*   **✨ Multi-Window Mania**
    Who said you can only have one conversation at a time? Open multiple windows and conquer multiple topics simultaneously. It’s organized chaos at its finest.

*   **🎨 Your App, Your Style: Full Theme Control**
    Choose between a sleek **Dark** mode, a clean **Light** mode, or let the app **sync with your OS**. Your eyes will thank you.

*   **🖼️ Expand Your Mind with Canvas Mode**
    Need more space for a complex thought? The app window automatically expands to a larger, more comfortable "Canvas" size when Gemini enters its immersive panel, perfect for deep dives.

*   **📌 Always-On-Top Mode: Your Unwavering AI Companion**
    Keep Gemini watching over your shoulder (in a non-creepy way) while you work. Perfect for coding, writing, or just feeling less alone.

*   **⌨️ Your Keys, Your Kingdom: Total Shortcut Customization**
    Don't like our default hotkeys? No problem! Dive into the settings and remap every single shortcut to fit your unique workflow.

*   **🚀 Run on Startup & Restore Session**
    Have GeminiDesk greet you the moment your computer boots up. You can also enable "Restore Windows" to have all your previous chat windows reopen exactly where you left them.

*   **🧠 The Little Things That Matter**
    We've ironed out all the wrinkles. **Persistent Login** (sign in once!), **Automatic Mic Permissions**, a **Smart Draggable Header** that shows your current chat title, and **Non-Intrusive Updates**. It just works.

## 💾 Installation

Getting this slab of awesome onto your machine is laughably simple.

1.  Brave the digital seas and navigate to the [**Latest Release**](https://github.com/hillelkingqt/GeminiDesk/releases/latest) page.
2.  Download the correct installer for your operating system (`.exe` for Windows, `.dmg` for macOS).
3.  Run the installer and follow the on-screen prompts. Click 'Next' like you mean it.

That's it! GeminiDesk is now ready for action.

### ⚠️ A Note for macOS Heroes ⚠️

Due to Apple's Gatekeeper security, apps not signed with a pricey Apple Developer ID get marked as "quarantined" when downloaded. This can cause a scary (but false) error message: “GeminiDesk is damaged and can’t be opened.”

**Fear not! Here’s the simple spell to fix it:**

1.  After installing, **do not launch the app yet**.
2.  Open your `Terminal` app (you can find it via Spotlight search).
3.  Paste and run this command. It removes the quarantine flag, telling macOS to trust the app:
    ```sh
    xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /Applications/GeminiDesk.app
    ```
4.  Now, launch the app normally from Launchpad or your Applications folder.

This one-time step is all it takes to get the best Gemini desktop app running smoothly on your Mac.
