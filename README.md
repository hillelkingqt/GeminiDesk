## ✨ Why Settle for a Tab When You Can Have a Throne? ✨

GeminiDesk is more than a wrapper. It's a command center, loaded with features that will make you wonder how you ever lived without them.

### 🌐 International & Accessible
*   **Multi-Language Support:** GeminiDesk speaks your language! The entire UI is translated into over 20 languages, with automatic language detection and full right-to-left (RTL) support for languages like Hebrew and Arabic. You can also select your language manually.

### 🧠 Core AI & Workflow Features
*   **📸 Screenshot to Chat:** Instantly snip any part of your screen with a hotkey. The image is magically beamed into your chat, ready for Gemini's brilliant analysis.
*   **📁 Universal File Drop:** Drag and drop images, PDFs, text files—almost any file—directly into the app. It's instantly ready for upload.
*   **⚡️ Instant Model Switching:** Use dedicated hotkeys to instantly fire up a new chat with either the lightning-fast **Flash** model or the powerhouse **Pro** model.
*   **🔎 Instant Chat Search:** Lost a brilliant idea in the chat abyss? Hit the search hotkey to immediately focus the search bar and unearth your past conversations.
*   **🤝 "Open With" Integration:** Set GeminiDesk as the default application for images or text files. Opening a file with the app will instantly load it into the chat.

### ⚙️ Powerful Window & Session Management
*   **🔄 Session & Window Restoration:** Never lose your place again! Enable a setting to remember all your open windows and their positions. Upon restart, all chats are fully restored.
*   **✨ Multi-Window Mania:** Who said you can only have one conversation at a time? Open multiple windows and conquer multiple topics simultaneously.
*   **📌 Always-On-Top Mode:** Keep Gemini watching over your shoulder while you work. Perfect for coding, writing, or just feeling less alone.
*   **🖼️ Canvas Mode:** Instantly expand the window to a larger, more comfortable size, perfect for deep dives and extensive conversations.
*   **🖥️ Fullscreen & Custom Header:** Go big with a dedicated fullscreen mode. The sleek, draggable header bar can even show your current chat's title.

### 🎨 Unmatched Customization
*   **⌨️ Your Keys, Your Kingdom:** Don't like our default hotkeys? No problem! Dive into the settings and remap every single shortcut to fit your unique workflow.
*   **🎨 Your App, Your Style:** Choose between a sleek **Dark** mode, a clean **Light** mode, or let the app **sync with your OS**.
*   **🛠️ Draggable Toolbar Buttons:** Reorder the main toolbar buttons (e.g., "New Chat," "Settings") just by dragging them. A "Reset Order" button is also available.
*   **⚙️ Fine-Tune Your UI:**
    *   Show or hide the app in the **taskbar**.
    *   Add a dedicated **close button (X)** to each chat window.
    *   Show or hide the current conversation's **title** in the header.
    *   Add a dedicated button to **export chats as PDFs**.

### 🚀 Quality of Life & Stability
*   **🔔 Enhanced Notification System:** The notification viewer now displays multiple server messages in a clean, navigable carousel.
*   **🚀 Run on Startup:** Have GeminiDesk greet you the moment your computer boots up.
*   **🧠 The Little Things That Matter:** We've ironed out all the wrinkles. **Persistent Login** (with improved, more reliable session handling), **Automatic Mic Permissions**, and **Smart, Non-Intrusive Updates**. It just works.

2.  Download the correct installer for your operating system (`.exe` for Windows, `.dmg` for macOS).

### ⚠️ A Note for macOS Heroes ⚠️

Due to Apple's Gatekeeper security, apps not signed with a pricey Apple Developer ID get marked as "quarantined" when downloaded. This can cause a scary (but false) error message: “GeminiDesk is damaged and can’t be opened.”

**Fear not! Here’s the simple spell to fix it:**

1.  After installing, **do not launch the app yet**.
2.  Open your `Terminal` app (you can find it via Spotlight search).
3.  Paste and run this command. It removes the quarantine flag, telling macOS to trust the app:
    ```sh
    xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /Applications/GeminiDesk.app
    ```
4.  Now, launch the app normally from Launchpad or your Applications folder.

This one-time step is all it takes to get the best Gemini desktop app running smoothly on your Mac.
