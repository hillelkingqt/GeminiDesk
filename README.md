## ‚ú® Why Settle for a Tab When You Can Have a Throne? ‚ú®

GeminiDesk is more than a wrapper. It's a command center, loaded with features that will make you wonder how you ever lived without them.

* **üì∏ Screenshot to Chat: See It, Snip It, Solve It!**
    Instantly snip any part of your screen with a hotkey. The image is magically beamed into your chat, ready for Gemini's brilliant analysis. It's like having a conversation with your screen!

* **üìÅ Universal File Drop: Your Files' New Best Friend**
    Drag and drop images, PDFs, text files‚Äîheck, almost any file‚Äîdirectly into the app. It's instantly ready for upload. The friction? Gone. The future? Now.

* **‚ö°Ô∏è Instant Model Switching: Flash or Pro? Decide in a Flash.**
    Why click through menus like a peasant? Use dedicated hotkeys to instantly fire up a new chat with either the lightning-fast **Flash** model or the powerhouse **Pro** model. Your workflow just got a nitrous boost.

* **üîé Find That Chat... Instantly!**
    Lost a brilliant idea in the chat abyss? Hit the search hotkey to immediately focus the search bar and unearth your past conversations. Your brain will thank you.

* **‚ú® Multi-Window Mania**
    Who said you can only have one conversation at a time? Open multiple windows and conquer multiple topics simultaneously. It‚Äôs organized chaos at its finest.

* **üìå Always-On-Top Mode: Your Unwavering AI Companion**
    Keep Gemini watching over your shoulder (in a non-creepy way) while you work. Perfect for coding, writing, or just feeling less alone in the universe.

* **‚å®Ô∏è Your Keys, Your Kingdom: Total Shortcut Customization**
    Don't like our default hotkeys? No problem! Dive into the settings and remap every single shortcut to fit your unique, beautiful, and probably weird workflow.

* **üöÄ Run on Startup**
    Have GeminiDesk greet you the moment your computer boots up. Because your AI assistant should be as ready to work as you are (or more so).

* **üñ•Ô∏è Fullscreen & Custom Header**
    Go big with a dedicated fullscreen mode. The sleek, draggable header bar even shows your current chat's title, so you always know what you're working on.

* **üß† The Little Things That Matter**
    We've ironed out all the wrinkles. **Persistent Login** (sign in once!), **Automatic Mic Permissions** (no more nagging pop-ups!), and **Smart, Non-Intrusive Updates**. It just works.
